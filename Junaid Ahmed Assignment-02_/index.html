       <li>  <h2><u>HTML:</u>  </h2> 
              <p><i>HTML is the language of the web, used to create and structure web pages with elements called tags and attributes.</i></p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                  <h3>Basic Structure</h3>
                  <p>An HTML document consists of a series of elements, which are enclosed in tags. Tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets, and most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the beginning of an element, and the closing tag signifies the end of that element. </p>
                </li>
              
               <li> 
                <h3>Elements and Attributes</h3>
                <p>HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about them or control their behavior. Attributes are always included in the opening tag of an element and are written as name-value pairs, separated by an equals sign (=) and surrounded by double quotes (").  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Accessibility and Best Practices</h3>
          <p>Creating accessible web content is crucial. HTML supports accessibility features such as alternative text for images (alt attribute), semantic elements, proper heading structure (<'h1'> to <'/h6'>), descriptive link text, and more. Following best practices ensures that web pages are usable and understandable by people with disabilities and across different devices and browsers.  </p>
             </li>
               </ul>
      </li>

      <li>  <h2><u>CSS:</u>  </h2>
        <p><i>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and enhance websites. It allows you to control how HTML elements are displayed on screen, paper, or other media.</i></p>
        <ul>
         <li>
           <h3>Basic Structure and Syntax</h3>
           <p>CSS operates on a simple principle: selectors are used to identify HTML elements on a webpage, and declarations are used to style those elements. A CSS rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block.specify what aspect of the element you want to change (like color or font-size). identify which element or elements the rule applies to (h1 targets all h1 elements).
          </p>
         </li>
       
        <li> 
         <h3>Cascading and Specificity</h3>
         <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets because styles can cascade from one rule to another, allowing multiple style sheets to be applied to a single document. If conflicting styles are applied to the same element, the specificity of the selector determines which style is applied. Specificity is based on the type of selector used and the number of instances of each type.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Box Model</h3>
      <p> 
        The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree. Each box has content, padding, borders, and margins. Understanding the box model is crucial for layout and positioning in CSS.
      </p>
      </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>  <h2><u>JAVASCRIPT:</u>  </h2>
        <p><i>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. </i></p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                  <h3>Basics and Syntax</h3>
                  <p>JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. JavaScript variables are declared using let and const. let allows reassigning values, while const creates constants that cannot be reassigned. </p>
                </li>
              
               <li> 
                <h3>ES6 and Modern JavaScript</h3>
                <p>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced significant enhancements to JavaScript, including arrow functions, template literals, classes, modules, destructuring assignments, and more. These features improve code readability, maintainability, and performance. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
          <p>JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js, and jQuery simplify complex tasks and enhance the development of single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic web applications.  </p>
